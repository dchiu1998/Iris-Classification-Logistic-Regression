# Iris-Classification-Logistic-Regression
Classify an Iris dataset in python using a self made implementation of logistic regression.

Use gradient descent in order to find the best decision boundary. Specify the step size, Î±, and tolerance level, T, in the main method
to change the number of iterations. A smaller step size and tolerance results in more iterations and better classification accuracy.
